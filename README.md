Python List Comprehension Demo

List comprehension is a way of initializing a list with an expression that's evaluated in a loop with optional conditions.
The code is elegant and easy to understand.

Tuples and Dictionaries can be initialized with comprehension, as well.

The demo program creates the following output:

Create a list of the powers of 2
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]

Create a list of tuples = (n, 2**n)
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 16), (5, 32), (6, 64), (7, 128), (8, 256), (9, 512), (10, 1024)]

Create a range of positive integers with a gap
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Creare a list of names that contain lower case 'a'
['Carole', 'Fiona', 'Gina', 'Hanah', 'Jasmine', 'Laura', 'Naomi', 'Oksana', 'Raven', 'Sara', 'Tina', 'Zara']

Creare a list of names that DO NOT contain lower case 'a'
['Anne', 'Beverly', 'Dierdre', 'Emily', 'Irene', 'Michelle', 'Penelope', 'Wendy', 'Yvonne']

Create two lists: powers of 2, and powers of 2 multiplied by the square root of two
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
[1.4, 2.8, 5.7, 11.3, 22.6, 45.3, 90.5]

Combine and sort the lists. This result is the range of full stops on a camera lens.
[1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.7, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, 32, 45.3, 64, 90.5, 128]


TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM:
